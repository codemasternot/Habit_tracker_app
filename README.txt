The Habit Tracking App allows users to add, remove, manage, and track their daily or weekly habits. Users can add new habits, remove existing ones, mark habits as complete, and check their streaks. The app provides a clean and intuitive command-line interface (CLI) for easy interaction. This is just the backend so the front end developer 
will have to set the GUI up, things like buttons and so on. Most things will have comments to help other people
understand my code.

Features
- Add new habits: Users can add new habits specifying whether they are daily or weekly.
- Remove habits: Existing habits can be removed from the app.
- List habits: Users can view a list of all existing habits.
- Check streaks: Users can check the streak count for a specific habit.
- Mark habits as complete: Users can mark a habit as complete, which updates the streak count accordingly.
- Find the habit with the longest streak: Users can find the habit with the longest streak across all habits.
